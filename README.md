## :rotating_light: What are you doing on my profile??? :rotating_light:

I live in Zagreb, and I'm trying to improve my knowledge of programming. 

#### What you will find on this page: 
- Shit code
- Barely readable writings
- Maths with various errors
- Maybe a cringe website

#### Tech stack&trade;:
Honestly I have nothing to put here, so here is some languages im somewhat familiar with (have made a 'Hello, World!' program or equivalent in lol!)
- C - `boomer.jpeg`
- Lua - `I made some arcade games with Love2D`
- Scheme - `currently reading SICP`
- Haskell - `very fun, mathematical!`
- Python - `also very fun`
- J\*va - `by necessity, not a fan!`
- Pseudocode - `The best language`

#### Other stuff:
I like maths. Not super good at it but I like it a lot. I'll prolly post some problems i find fun on some repository here. 
Also design and art. Both trad and digital.

I'll finish this page later.
